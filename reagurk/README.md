# reagurk

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev). It uses [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) as it's primary language and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.


## Setup

To install the required dependencies, run `yarn install`.

To start the development server on http://localhost:3000, run `yarn start`.

To build for production, run `yarn build` and start the production server on http://localhost:5000 with `yarn serve`.

Make sure to lint with the `yarn lint` command.
